# Convenient, locally runnable youtube to mp3 file converter
You are using youtube for listening to music or podcasts, but are annoyed by the ads (especially on mobile devices), the requirement to leave your screen unlocked (especially on mobile devices), or the requirement to be online while doing so?
You are not keen (or too paranoid) to use any of the (often) sketchy online conversion websites for downloading youtube content, which package who-knows-what into the downloaded files? You want to be able to prepare your podcasts or publicly available audio books as mp3 files for travel or the gym?

Then you probably want to check out this convenient project providing simple youtube-to-mp3-conversion capabilities using [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) and [https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) in a simple purposeful GUI (TODO).

Please note that this is in no way a professional or professionally maintained repository and mainly exists for my own benefit and amusement.
